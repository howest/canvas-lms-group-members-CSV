## canvas-lms-group-members-csv
This is a plugin for Canvas LMS to add/edit group members with a CSV file.

Displays two options in the Groups tool: Add students / Edit groups. When clicking on any of the two options, shows a dialog where the user can select a csv file. The plugin reads the file and modifies the group members accordingly. When using the option to edit group members, the members that are not included in the file are removed from the group.
